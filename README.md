99% of this game's assets are taken from other games/internet/mods.

This is a 100% HTML-CSS-JavaScript 3D first person party-based RPG set in a semi-historical 18th century.
Manage a group of adventurers from various cultures, and explore the WHOLE world.

Everything you see is a div. I'm not a code expert so I relied quite a lot on chatGPT. Code might look extremely ugly and obviously unefficient. But things work!

START THE GAME:
Launch the run.bat file, which is going to create a local server on which you can play the game through the browser (WebKit only supported!).

Game is IN DEVELOPMENT.


Enjoy.
