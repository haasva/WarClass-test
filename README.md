This is a 100% HTML-CSS-JavaScript 3D first person party-based RPG set in a semi-historical 18th century.
Manage a group of adventurers from various cultures, and explore the WHOLE world.

Everything you see is an html div. I'm not a code expert so I relied quite a lot on chatGPT. Code might look extremely ugly and obviously unefficient. But things work!

START THE GAME:
Launch the run.bat file, which is going to create a local server on which you can play the game through the browser (WebKit only supported!).

The pixelated effect is a filter, it can be disabled (just change the css of the #neo-region element).

Game is IN DEVELOPMENT.

## How to play

Select your starting adventurers/location. Move around like any other FPS game. Movement is cell-based.

Adventurers can attack if they have a weapon equiped. Use the wheel to change the active adventurer.

Browse the world map to change regions (teleport) or travel by foot through the region (gateways are revealed cells at the borders of the map with a red border).
Etc.

## Contact
you can contact me for anything. I'm really looking for feedback, both gamedesign and programming wise.

## Future
Continue to build the game.

Implement working group vs group combat.

Find a way to abandon cell-based movement (Daggerfall-like movement instead).
