This is a 100% HTML-CSS-JavaScript 3D first person party-based RPG set in a semi-historical 18th century.
Manage a group of adventurers from various cultures, and explore the WHOLE world.

Everything you see is an html <div>. I'm not a code expert so I relied quite a lot on chatGPT. Code might look extremely ugly and obviously unefficient. But things work!

START THE GAME:
Launch the run.bat file, which is going to create a local server on which you can play the game through the browser (WebKit only supported!).

The pixelated effect is a filter, it can be disabled (just change the css of the #neo-region element).

Game is IN DEVELOPMENT.
