<p>Magellanica. Some believe it was discovered by Magellan himself over two hundred years ago, only to fall into oblivion. In 1733, a Dutch expedition returning from the Pacific brought news of an unknown land, vast and seemingly uninhabited. Subsequent journeys confirmed the existence of what appeared to be a new continent in the middle of the ocean. Initially overlooked, this new land quickly became the most sought-after territory when the Pestilence broke out.</p>

<p>The disease, a plague of a new kind, spread so rapidly through the Old and the New World that this distant land became a refuge, far from the scourge that was taking millions of lives, contaminating people through mere proximity. And so, the rest of the world was nearly abandoned, with the few who managed to escape founding new colonies in Magellanica.</p>

<p>Travel to and from Magellanica was soon strictly limited to keep the Pestilence out, and eventually, the continent shut itself off completely. Outside, the surviving population was left to a dying world filled with violence and isolation. Old nations and empires fell into ruin, and people organized themselves into small, autarkic communities, striving to preserve their cultures, policies, and military traditions, but gradually becoming more decadent and barbaric.</p>

<p>The Pestilence is a constant threat to anyone not fortunate enough to be equipped with the only known means of repelling it: burning specific resins, whose smoke must be diffused in the air around them. Consequently, these resins have become a vital currency for travelers. Moving from one place to another without the shroud of the resin smoke is an almost guaranteed death.</p>

<p>Contact between Magellanica and the rest of the world has not ceased entirely though. There is a scarce but steady demand for people with certain skills and knowledge. These specialized needs are contracted out to a Magellanic company, who keeps the route to their land secret, and then reach out to what are known as "Passeurs": rare, experienced, and intrepid striders tasked with fulfilling these bids. Passeurs search for the needed individuals and bring them, uncontaminated, to a departure point whose location is kept secret. However, Passeurs are in competition with one another, with the reward going only to the fastest who reach the departure point with the correct cargo. It's a high-risk job. It's your job. Swing your thurible, Passeur!</p>
